# dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles. They are applied using the ```applyconfig.sh```
script. **This script must be run from the working tree of this repo!!!**
The script depends on [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).
The repo of the Nord theme for Openbox can be found [here]
(https://github.com/the-zero885/Nord-Openbox-theme).

I hope you'll find something interesting!
